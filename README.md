This is a project for DevMountain that is a Pokemon Randomizer using the PokeAPI. Thank you for giving this a test! 

This project is quite simple, with a mere button press generating a random pokemon through all generations. Running on Express alongside Axios and Vanilla JavaScript. This project taught me a lot regarding API implementation and how its not a simple call and done. The pokeAPI was loads of fun to work with however, and I can see myself using it again.

If you're ever building a team or need a new pokemon to look for, this is your spot to look!
